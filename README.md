todo:
- why isn't note_new working in deployment?
- load notes on page load

ideas:
- create a wiki-like annotation system
	- allow users to be notified of modifications to annotations
	- allow users to + or - value of annotations
		- consider different dimensions?
			- true/false
			- redundant/novel
			- relevant/not
	- allow users to set an expiration date for annotations
	- allow users to mark annotations as expired
- annotation summary
	- group annotations when they are near on the interface
- TTC data
	- show nearby buses
	- relate buses to the route they are on
	- relate routes to service outages
	- create a route planner that takes reliability into account
- offline support
	- is there really that much map data if you just download, say, all the roads as strings and vectors?
	- can a website locally cache map data it's received?
